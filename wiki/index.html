    <h2>What is BordSMP?</h2>
    <p>
        Border + Bored = Bord Survival Multiplayer for Minecraft
        <br>
        This server is the spiritual successor of the old vanilla Minecraft server made better and more social with a few changes.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>

    <p>
        BordSMP is hosted on an on-demand server, meaning anybody can turn on the server whenever they want to play. The server is open to play for anyone that knows someone who plays on the server.

    <h2>Gameplay Changes</h2>
    <h3>Main Changes</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            There is an invisible border around spawn.
        </li>
        <li>
            Beds cannot be slept in outside of this border, so respawn will always be within the border.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wearing armor outside the border causes the wearer to suffer damage over time.
        </li>
        <li>
            Being in the Nether or the End is considered outside of the border.
        </li>
        <li>
            Command '/inborder' will inform you whether or not you're in the border.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Additional Changes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Dying to pvp where either player is in the border loses the killed no items or levels.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fortune has been removed for pickaxes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Infinity has been removed for bows.
        </li>
        <li>
            Respawn anchors have been removed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Shulker boxes have been removed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Elytra have been removed.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Game Settings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Sleep through night: </b> Disabled
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Insomnia (phantoms):</b> Disabled
        </li>

            <b>Achievements:</b> Hidden
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Game Rules</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Using lava to grief within the border is against the rules. Same with lava casting.
        </li>
        <li>
            Abusing overlooked ways to get removed items/enchants is considered against the spirit of the game.
        </li>
        <li>
            Because the server is dynamically allocated, solo afk farming costs Jacob money. Afk farming should be limited to when other players are playing on the server.
        </li>
        <li>
            Infinite TNT is considered against the rules. Doubly so within or near the border.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cheating using x-ray or hacked clients is against the rules. Not an anarchy server.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h2>Game Guidelines</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Taking items from another player's chest is not against the server rules; however, player discretion should be advised as the game does not lift social responsibilities in the real world.
        </li>
        <li>
            Griefing is discouraged; however, due to the size restraint of the border, some tearing down/collision with other people's builds is to be expected. In these conflicts, players are asked to try being open minded.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pvp follows the same as point 1.
        </li>
    </ol>
