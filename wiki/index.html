    <h3>Gameplay Changes</h3>
    <h4>Main Changes</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            There is an invisible border around spawn.
        </li>
        <li>
            Beds cannot be slept in outside of this border, so respawn a will always be within the border.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wearing armor outside the border causes the wearer to suffer damage over time.
        </li>
        <li>
            Players will not be able to build on the border itself. Players can still destroy blocks on the border.
        </li>
        <li>
            Being in the Nether or the End is considered outside of the border.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Additional Changes</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Dying to pvp within the border loses the killed no items or levels.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fortune from pickaxes has been removed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Infinity from bows has been removed.
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
            Elytra picked up turn into phantom membranes effectively removing Elytra.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Game Settings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Sleep does not skip the night.
        </li>
        <li>
            Insomnia (phantoms) has been disabled.
        </li>
        <li>
            Difficulty set to Hard.
        </li>
        <li>
            Border set to 65 radius.
        </li>
        <li>
            World limit set to 2k radius.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pvp is on.
        </li>
        <li>
            Achievements are hidden.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Game Rules</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Using lava to grief in town is against the rules. Same with lava casting.
        </li>
        <li>
            Abusing overlooked ways to get removed items/enchants is considered against the spirit of the game.
        </li>
        <li>
            Because the server is dynamically allocated, solo afk farming costs Jacob money. Afk farming should be limited to when other players are playing on the server.
        </li>
        <li>
            Infinite TNT is considered against the rules. Doubly so within or near the border.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cheating using x-ray or hacked clients against the rules. Not an anarchy server.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Game Guidelines</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Taking items from another player's chest is not against the server rules; however, player discretion should be advised as the game does not lift social responsibilities in the real world.
        </li>
        <li>
            Griefing is discouraged; however, due to the size restraint of the border, some tearing down/collision with other people's builds is to be expected. In these conflicts, players are asked to try being open minded. "Kitsugi" and what not.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pvp follows the same as point 1.
        </li>
    </ol>
