
TODO:
-test putting new players and stuff like that file and stuff


-remove all armor on renounce.- readd new golden helmet

-think about allowing all weapons and enchants for weapons. Am I afraid of sneak attacks doing too much damage? players should be able to merk mobs once they get strong enough i think.
-players lose time when they kill each other far away from home, which is already too real....
-so allow axe and sword full enchants....? and let players self decide whether or not they want to pvp with super op tools
-still want to remove fortune and infinity - can replace either with mending.
-i dont think players are going to be keen on fighting unless agreed upon
- i think i was too ambitious with the idea of switching between wooden sword and iron sword for pvp. too far....
-what happens when no potato??? do players have to grind out 200 zombies? for 1 miracle potato? I think that would be kind of sick.
-Yeah, what if I keep fortune and infinity normal too actually. Keep it like normal minecraft.....at the same time though, i do think those two things are particularly annoying... would be actually neat to replace both with mending.
-yeah set on fortune and infinity changes.  everything else can be normal. if it gets out of hand, I can nerf

-I think everything else is fine.
-I think people are going to want to play simple minecraft, without all these edge cases..
-players can keep trident on death.
-not sure, will have to think on this.

--what's the consequence of dying?
--what's the benefit of building structures if everybody retains all of their stuff? why build a farm when you never lose stuff? should players still lose their belongins on death.........And does that make this too hard? it also disincentivizes pvp, but i don't think that's what this server is about anymore... on pvp kill maybe retain inventory? but this can easily be abused to fast travel home. probably keep it simple lose everything like normal minecraft. This border will be a stay home mechanic. and those who leave are brave

--everybody is a glass cannon in this world...
--everybody is protected from the consequences of death in this world too apparently
--also no resouces are bled and lost...I think this is okay.this will be a build server anyways.

-yeah maybe don't change the challenges of the game too too much. keep it simple.
--still not adding the End though. lag of elytra + shulkers boxes are too op. plus ender pearls and ender farms are too op.

For Townie/General:
-email list/text msg for people for when the server turns on plus one player gets on :)
-convert data format to json rather than serialized

For buttered:



Need to playtest:
Seriously consider buttered players losing everything besides hat. Minecraft is a hard game, no reason it should not be punishing....
Keeping it simple......
-a counter point though is that out of the border, no beds can be placed, so the distance traveled to the sight of death to recollect belongings can be tough.
-maybe that's just life.
-this super encourages players to stay close to home.
-honestly makes sense.

-so the only real changes are seasonsed meats, which I could remove...
-added buttered potato
-butter status
-border
-no building as townie outside of border
-pvp only as butter
-no armor except for butter as butter
-remove fortune for pickaxe, and infinity from bow.
-no end
-no insomnia
-no beds outside of border
-ask for change grants 1 gn per minecraft day. so it takes 9*5 minecraft days for a helmet which is 45*20 min which is 15 hrs. ask a friend to join, and it's much faster

Tested:


Untested:
-butter has pvp, but townie doesnt
-check that border in nether should behave the exact same way as over world. this will allow non buttered to travel far out, but will die slowly in over world

Added changes for patch notes:
-Added border at 65 radius where non-buttered will begin taking damage, world border of 65 might be sufficient for our player base size
-Cannot sleep outside of radius 65
-cannot place blocks on line 66
-remove automatic gold farming from piglins
-for general no body gets to place blocks on WORLD border radius +1
-fortune for pickaxes turns into mending in enchantment table
-fortune unable to be added to pickaxes in anvil.
- limit enchants for sword and axe to just wooden sword and axe
-limit sword and axe to iron max
-days can no longer be progressed by sleeping
-quickshot/power for crossbows/bows removed. enchanted books with quickshot/power cannot be found. A crossbow or bow enchanted with either is replaced with mending. An enchanted book that would've been enchanted with either is given unbreaking 1 instead.
-unnerf food - tested
-buffed seasoned steak, might be doing too much gotta, check. not sure if it's double eating food, i don't think it is though, bc i manually set the value
-keep cookie
-prevent from placing blocks outside as townie?
-remove respawn anchor usage
    -remove craftability
-buttered transform
-test leaving and entering town is consistent, should leave town right on >= 65
-test should not be able to build on 65
-add renounce command, can only be called in hometown.
-add condition to make self buttered. like a command. wearing butter uniform and eat the buttered potato, 
-as buttered losing only levels and tridents on death, retain all inventory
-replaced infinity with mending
-replaces crown with indestructable butter hat. 
-can't put other armor on while buttered

changes hidden to viewer:
- Added player moveportal event, for returning to town safely updating it instantly, bc rn player continues to take dmg until he moves, same with respawn
-curse of binding on tridents when buttered works as expected


World settings:
vanilla server properties
difficulty: hard
pvp: true
spawn protection: 0
seed: must be determined
World limit: thinking 2k radius is solid
set world spawn near center


bukkit server properties
end: not available

Game rules:
achievements hidden
Bed's don't progress day - just set sleep percentage of 100
remove insomnia

Socially imposed rules:
Hacks/Cheats are strictly against the rules e.g. hacked clients, x-ray
Pouring lava for griefing in town is strictly against the rules, lava for construction and decor, traps is fine
lava/water casting in town is discouraged.
Glitches to get around plugin restrictions are against the spirit of the game. Once found, will be added to a list of bugs to eventually fix.
solo AFK farming is against the rules. - to keep the server inexpensive. afk farming while other player's are playing is fine. 

1. taking items from other player chests is fine in the eyes of the server owner. player discretion should be advised as the game does not lift social responsibilities in the real world. assuming no x-ray
2. griefing is discouraged. however, due to the size restraint of town, some tearing down/collision with other people's is to be expected. In these conflicts, players are asked to become open minded. "Kitsugi" and what not.


pvp is allowed, but again go to point 1.



Later things:

    For when things get out of hand:
    -WorldGaurd for tnt and lava flow in spawn
    -anti x ray if there are cheaters. would have to ban them
    -askforchange - for when gold is extracted out so players can't leave.
    -add change command. drops player a few gold nuggets, and can be called only once per minecraft day, should also say a random thing in the player's perspective from a pool of things. "I am v poor. Can some spare some change? I promise I won't spend it on fancy cookies." "Help! Family was kidnapped by herobrine. I need 3gb and 3gn to afford karate lessons to save my family!" "Oinky-doinky, me's poor and stinky. Can anybody feed me, uwu?" 
    -nerf power/quickcharge/fireworks/trident/sword/axe whatever is needed to be done.

    For Tracking for more fun:
    -buttered streak Tracking
    -more gold when asking for change by how long you were alive as buttered
    -maybe keeping track of staying alive is boring.. incentivizes passive play
    -should incentivize hunting. keep track of killed gold :) number of gold dropped from killed players + food items - in one life :), only shows current streak. and number of butter kills
    -score is displayed via, butter-deathmatch /bdm


Name:
BordSMP - short for border or was it bored?

It is not theft. It is certain reality of survival in a resource constrained commune.
