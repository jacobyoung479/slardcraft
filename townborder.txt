TODO:

-maybe make nether bordered too 1/4 if I want to let all enchantments back in the game - but enchantments are so lameeee
-convert all found enchanted armor in to enchanted leather variants lol
-the gold players must come back and feed the townies. Guide them out lmao. Maybe you can't even enter the nether while being a townie? nah just do the border inside.
-til a command called reload, which reloads all the plugin jars
-later on make, a command called -handout, gives a few gold nuggets each minecraft day can only be called once a minecraft day.
